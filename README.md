# Airline Cybersecurity Threat Model
    
    ## Project Overview
    This project is a security threat modeling and risk assessment exercise focused on a modern commercial airline environment. The goal is to identify realistic cyber threats against airline IT infrastructure, operational technology systems, and customer-facing platforms, and to document detection and response strategies.
    
    The assessment models systems including:
    - Passenger reservation and ticketing systems
    - Airport Wi-Fi networks
    - Mobile boarding pass applications
    - Baggage handling systems
    - Aircraft communication systems
    - Vendor and third-party integrations
    - Employee authentication and identity systems
    
    This project is designed to demonstrate practical blue-team cybersecurity thinking: threat identification, attack paths, impact analysis, and defensive monitoring.
    
    ## Methodology
    Threat modeling was performed using a **STRIDE-based framework**:
    - **S** — Spoofing
    - **T** — Tampering
    - **R** — Repudiation
    - **I** — Information Disclosure
    - **D** — Denial of Service
    - **E** — Elevation of Privilege
    
    Each system was evaluated for realistic attack vectors and mapped to detection and response procedures.
    
    ## Deliverables
    - Full Threat Model Report
    - STRIDE Risk Analysis Table
    - Incident Response Playbook
    
    ## Purpose
    This project demonstrates how a security analyst evaluates business risk, identifies adversary behavior, and proposes defensive monitoring strategies in a regulated and high-availability industry.
    No real airline data or proprietary systems were used in this assessment.
